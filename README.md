# VolToVoMe

Is a short for Volume to Voice Meter

This little tool is a bridge which takes the currently set up computer volume, and sends it to voicemeter via its api.

80% volume is 100% in Voicemeter, as voicemeter can go higher.

There is a little rule of three involved, slowing down the volume increase above the voicemeter 100%


Oh, right. Tool requires "VoicemeeterRemote.dll" and / or "VoicemeeterRemote64.dll" which you may be able to find in the voicemeter executable directories or on google ;)
